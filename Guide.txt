Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 records
ii. Business table = 10000 records
iii. Category table = 10000 records
iv. Checkin table = 10000 records
v. elite_years table = 10000 records
vi. friend table = 10000 records
vii. hours table = 10000 records
viii. photo table = 10000 records
ix. review table = 10000 records
x. tip table = 10000 records
xi. user table = 10000 records
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
Select Count(DISTINCT id)
From Business

ii. Hours = 1562
Select Count(DISTINCT business_id)
From hours

iii. Category = 2643
Select Count(DISTINCT business_id)
From Category

iv. Attribute = 1115 
Select Count(DISTINCT business_id)
From Attribute

v. Review = 
10000
Select Count(DISTINCT id)
From Review
8090
Select Count(DISTINCT business_id)
From Review
9581
Select Count(DISTINCT user_id)
From Review

vi. Checkin = 493 
Select Count(DISTINCT business_id)
From Checkin

vii. Photo =
6493 
Select Count(DISTINCT business_id)
From Photo
10000
Select Count(DISTINCT id)
From Photo

viii. Tip = 
537
Select Count(DISTINCT user_id)
From Tip
3979 
Select Count(DISTINCT business_id)
From Tip

ix. User = 10000
Select Count(DISTINCT id)
From user

x. Friend = 11
Select Count(DISTINCT user_id)
From friend

xi. Elite_years =2780
Select Count(DISTINCT user_id)
From elite_years

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Hours, 19, 5, 12, 11, 7
Yes, they have a different distribution of hours. The number of stars increases as the mnumber of hours decreases. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
SELECT name, city, category, business.id, stars, COUNT(*) As StarCount, hours, review_count

Yes, the data shows that the restaurant with the highest rating has the least amount of reviews. The data shows that the Bootleggers restaurant might have
a more reliable rating because it has the most reviews and is still highly rated. 

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

I infer that the population around Bootleggers is higher than other areas because it is close to Gallagher's. Both have a high number of reviews. 
I infer that they are located on main streets and areas that are more accessible to a larger group of people such as a mall or shopping plaza. 
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
        The restaurants that are open has more reviews than the closed restaurants.  
         
ii. Difference 2:
        The restaurants that are open are open for less time. 
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT name, city, category, business.id, stars, COUNT(*) As StarCount, hours, review_count, neighborhood, address, postal_code, is_open
From business
Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id 
Inner join hours on business.id = hours.business_id
Where city = 'Phoenix' and category.category = 'Restaurants'
Group by is_open

name                          | city    | category    | id                     | stars | StarCount | hours                | review_count | neighborhood | address             | postal_code | is_open |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I will analyze to understand the correlation between number of stars and photos for business(restaurants)

         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I will need to look at the business with category restaurants and look at all the columns from the photo table                 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:   

id                     | name                     | neighborhood  | address                          | city            | state | postal_code | latitude | longitude | stars | review_count | is_open | business_id            | category    | id                     | business_id            | caption       | label   |

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
 SELECT *
From business
Inner join category on business.id = category.business_id 
Inner join photo on business.id = photo.business_id
Where category.category = 'Restaurants'
order by stars ASC     

Analysis: The data shows that the ratings for the restaurants increase if the picture is of the food and it contains a caption. 
The ratings will decrease if the photos are taken outside rather than inside. The marketing team for the business should focus on
captioning all of their photos and making sure the photos focus on the food.
